# ⚡The Electric Revolution Has a Waste Problem— Reflo Has a Solution

**The electric revolution is here — and lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries are powering it all.**
From zippy EVs to mobility scooters, power tools, and massive solar and wind energy storage systems (BESS), the humble “18650” Li-ion cell is everywhere.

*But there’s a catch:*
Li-ion cells are resource-intensive to make, rely on **heavy metals** and **toxic chemicals**, and over **98% end up in landfills**, leaching pollutants and posing long-term safety risks. Many of these discarded cells still have usable life left— they just aren't suitable for high-performance applications anymore.

> **Reflo turns waste into opportunity.**
Our AI-powered platform analyzes Li-ion battery health in real time during charging. Just conect your cells to a Reflo unit, and get instant insights on their remaining capacity and ideal second-life use cases— like repurposing a used mobility scooter battery to store energy from a home solar system.

Reflo empowers builders, recyclers, and organizations to give batteries a second chance— and keep toxic waste out of our soil and water.

***With Reflo, the power is truly in your hands.***
